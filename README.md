Service Workers and graceful degradation are related because both make web applications more reliable and work better in unideal environments. Service Workers run separately from the main web app and can handle tasks like caching and offline support. This allows websites to work with low connection levels. This makes it so that it will work at a basic level more often than not. This is especially true for keeping a consistent project along more devices.
